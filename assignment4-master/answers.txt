2) Because it needs to search through just as many elements as it needs to find the next element,

4) The standard library sort function is faster than the hand-coded sort functions due to the fact that the std::sort is optimized for several types of data types.
According to GeeksForGeeks.com, the std::sort function has been shown to operate between 250% to 1000% faster than the
hand written sorts. Source: (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-qsort-vs-c-sort/)
Also, it is because it uses quickSort
